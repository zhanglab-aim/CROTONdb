For the gene info, it might be a good time to introduce SQL, the relational database manager. Basically we need one table A 
that stores gene -> PAM, and another table B that stores PAM -> variants and their scores. This will make the counting easier 
by only looking at table A. I havenâ€™t thought enough about what would be the best database layout for croton, but we are going 
to use SQL anyways so might be better to start looking at how SQL works with Python
